# A Bash Firewall IPTables Wrapper

This is a little bash script to generate, modify, and view IPTable rules. It can also export an HTML report of the current rules to the Desktop, offers menu item descriptions for clarification, and utilizes UFW to receive active status information. To run, you must execute as root:

>sudo ./firewall.sh

This will open up the main menu which allows you to:

1. Check if IPTables Installed
2. Install IPTables
3. Iptables Services
4. Build Your Firewall with Iptables
